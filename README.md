# Black Box
Black Box was a board game published by the Waddingtons in the 1970s. The game consists of players shooting rays into a black box, an area the users know nothing about.
As they traverse through this Black Box, the rays change position as they encounter "atoms", the objects that the players are looking for. In particular, there are the
following types of interactions:
- Hit
- Deflection
- Reflection
- Double Deflection
- Miss
- Detour

Each Entry and Exit location count as a point. Per the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Box_(game)) page, "Hits and reflections therefore cost one point, while detours cost two points. When the seeker guesses the location of the atoms in the grid, each misidentified atom position costs penalty points: ten in the original Waddingtons rules, five in the Parker Brothers version and most computer editions." For this implementation, the penalty points are decided in accordance to the latter.
